A University admits new students using a criterion with three variables; KCSE grade score, 
interview questions score and confidence level score during admission interviews. A new student 
is admitted if he/she passes KCSE grade score and any one of the remaining scores.
The table below summarises the admission criterion.

Variable Condition for passing
KCSE grades A student scores 65 points and above 
Interview questions scores A student scores 6 and above 
Confidence level score A student scores 5 and above 

Instruction: Write a java program, which takes in values of the three variables and determine if a 
new student shall be admitted or rejected by printing out the results statement.
